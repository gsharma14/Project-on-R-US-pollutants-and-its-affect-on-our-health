# Project-on-R-US-pollutants-and-its-affect-on-our-health
The project is about the level of various pollutants in USA and the reason as to why we have such high index value of the pollutants. I have tried to publish the affect it has on our health, especially various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. It has linear modelling, correlation and time series analysis.
